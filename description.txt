Overhauls the Tax Collector to be more useful with a few small changes:
    * Increases the Tax Collector's money cap to 10 platinum rather than 10 gold.
    * Increases profit depending on how far in the game you are, including support for both Calamity and Thorium. See the forum post at http://bit.ly/2JLBAtF.
    * Adds a config file stored in the save directory to modify the above values as well as the paycheck rate and money cap. When joining a server, the config file on the machine's installation of Terraria will be used and enforced.
    * Adds a basic system in the config to add custom rent values for mods, given programming knowledge. See https://bit.ly/2VAjD3y.
