# Better Taxes Config File
The config file is written in JSON and has 4 fields, which are elaborated on below.
Make sure you always backup your custom configs.
- TaxRates
    - This field is a dictionary which maps "keys" to the amount of money given per paycheck.
    - Each "key" consists of a list and a condition, separated by a period. For example, `Base.crimson` is the key, `Base` is the list, and `crimson` is the condition.
	- There are three built-in lists: `Base`, `Calamity`, and `Thorium`. The `Calamity` and `Thorium` lists will always return false regardless of the condition if the corresponding mod is not installed.
    - Here is a list of every single key with the list `Base`:
        - `Base.always`: Always set to true. Use this for a "default value."
		- `Base.never`: Always set to false.
        - `Base.downedMechBossAny`: Any mechanical boss has been defeated.
        - `Base.downedMechBossAll`: All mechanical bosses have been defeated.
        - `Base.downedPlantBoss:` Plantera has been defeated.
        - `Base.downedGolemBoss`: Golem has been defeated.
        - `Base.downedAncientCultist`: The Lunatic Cultist has been defeated.
        - `Base.downedMoonlord`: The Moon Lord has been defeated.
        - `Base.expertMode`: The world is in expert mode.
        - `Base.crimson`: The world generated with crimson.
	- Here is a list of every single key with the list `Calamity`:
        - `Calamity.downedProvidence`: Providence has been defeated.
		- `Calamity.downedDoG`: The Devourer of Gods has been defeated.
        - `Calamity.downedYharon`: Yharon has been defeated.
        - `Calamity.downedSCal`: Supreme Calamitas has been defeated.
	- Here is a list of every single key with the list `Thorium`:
        - `Thorium.downedRealityBreaker`: The Ragnarök has been defeated.
	- There is one exception to the list/condition format: if you would like to use a flag from another mod, the following format is used instead: `<mod name>.<mod world>.<value>`. For example, `CalamityMod.CalamityWorld.downedDoG` would evaluate to true once the Devourer of Gods has been defeated, and this would be what you would use if the Calamity list did not exist. You may want to look inside the source code of the mod you wish to retrieve values from.
	- Multiple keys can be separated by a logic gate inside the same line with "and," "or", and "not," as follows: `Base.crimson and Base.expertMode` `Base.downedMechBossAny or Base.crimson` `not Base.expertMode`
	- You can combine logic gates, as follows: `Base.expertMode and not Base.crimson` `Base.expertMode and Base.downedMechBossAll and Base.crimson`
- TimeBetweenPaychecks
    - This field corresponds to the amount of time that is separated between paychecks, or when money is contributed to the Tax Collector's "storage." In vanilla Terraria, this is 60 seconds. Note that when the Enchanted Sundial is being used, one second corresponds to what would otherwise be a minute.
- MoneyCap
    - This field corresponds to the maximum amount of money, represented in copper coins, that the Tax Collector will hold at one period of time. In vanilla Terraria, this is 10 gold, or 100,000 copper.
- AddCustomDialog
    - This field is a boolean (true or false) which corresponds to whether or not the new lines of dialog should be added to the Tax Collector's dialog pool.
